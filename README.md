# Business Performance Comparison
This project applies data science techniques to analyze and visualize year-over-year financial metrics for 2022 and 2023. By leveraging Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, it demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and insight generation. The analysis includes key metrics such as revenue, operating expenses, and profitability, showcasing actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Growth rates are calculated to measure financial performance trends, and visualizations are created to communicate findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders. This project highlights my ability to work with real-world financial data, derive meaningful insights, and translate those insights into business value-key competencies for data science positions.
