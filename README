The results of this project were derived from analyzing META’s Reality Lab’s Division, a new sector established in 2020, that focuses on researching and developing immersive technology (i.e. virtual reality).The findings are a quick demonstration of data analytics techniques to analyze and visualize year-over-year financial metrics for 2022 and 2023, using real data extracted from SEC.org. 

By utilizing Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, it demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and prediction. The key-metrics the project focused on were revenue, operating expenses, and profitability, showcasing actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Growth rates are calculated to measure financial performance trends, and visualizations are created to communicate findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders. This project highlights my ability to work with real-world financial data, derive meaningful insights, and translate those insights into business competencies for data analyst positions.
